# KISS-CoC
Ah yes, even yet *another* Code of Conduct.

But in all seriousness, the Keep It Simple Stupid Code of Conduct aims to be a complete departure from other CoC's that seem to focus on openness and justice on the surface, but in reality, are based on weaponization and discrimination. (I'm looking at YOU, Contributor Covenant!)

This CoC, however, is based solely on merit, the code, potential downfalls other CoC's don't accommodate, keeping it simple and blunt, and nothing more. 

To learn more about the reasoning behind this CoC, please visit the [No Code of Conduct](https://github.com/domgetter/NCoC) repo.
